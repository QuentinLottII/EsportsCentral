    <h2> What are Esports? </h2>

    <p> To put it simply for those who are out of touch, Esports is competitive gaming.
        Despite stereotypes you may have heard of nerds living in their mom’s basement, playing games 24/7, these are highly skilled and highly paid professionals.
        These people are the best at what they do and compete for millions of dollars in prize money in front of millions of other people.
        It's been around since the late 80s and has had a surge of popularity over the past decade due to streaming platforms such as Twitch.</p>

    <h2> Where did it come from? </h2>
    <p> Esports began in the late 20th century following games such as Space Invaders and Space War, with the tournaments and prize pool were very small.
        It wasn’t until the “Red Annihilation” tournament for the game Quake in May of 1997 where Esports really kicked off in the US.
        The winner of that tournament walked away with a brand new Ferrari.
        It became a global phenomenon with the release of Blizzard’s real time strategy game “StarCraft” in 1998, and it’s sudden emergence in South Korea.
        Now, it's fairly common to see Esports tournaments being broadcasted over the internet. </p>

    <h2> What qualifies as an Esport? </h2>
    <p>For a game to really qualify as an Esport, it needs some sort of competitive element and ranking system.
        If they don't have a ranking system, then they must find some other way to determine the skills of each individual user.
        A lot of games use the Elo System, which is often used in Chess.
        The most popular Esports genres are: First Person Shooters, Real Time Strategy Games, and MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas).
        There have been other games outside of this genre that can be considered, such as Minecraft.</p>
