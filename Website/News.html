                 <p> Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf, a 16 year old from Pennsylvania, wins the Fortnite World Cup and $3,000,000 USD in prize money. </p>
                 <p> Millions attempted to qualify for the Fornite World Cup but only 100 made it.
                     Out of the 100 contestants from around the world, Giersdorf was the one who stood at the mountain top.
                     Giersdorf was miles ahead of everyone else on the overall leaderboard, and finsihed the final match in first place with multiple elimations.
                     The Fortnite World Cup is also the first time in Esports history where multiple high placing contestants were North Americans.
                     Typically North America was seen as the weaker region in Esports when compared to Europe and Asia. Could this be a sign of North American resurgence in Esports? </p></li>

        <img class = "picture" src = "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/819/057/2bdad8ff869eddcc6eee35a918a40542_crop_north.jpg?h=533&w=800&q=70&crop_x=center&crop_y=top">

        <p> The Overwatch League Team known as the "Shanghai Dragons" were considered the worst team in both Esports and Sports history.
            The team had a historic 40 game losing streak before they rebuilt and retooled their roster for the second season of the Overwatch League.
            The Dragons dropped all of their player except Weida "Diya" Lu and Seyeon "Geguri" Kim. They then proceeded to pick up most of the members of the tier 2 Korean team "Kongdoo Panthera", now known as "Team Griffin".
            Their new pick-ups included: DPS players Youngjin "YOUNGJIN" Jin, Minseong "Diem" Bae, and Jinhyeok "DDING" Yang, Tank players Youngjin "Gamsu" Noh and Junhwan "GuardiaN" Jo, and Supports Kyungwoo "CoMa" Son and Seonghyeon "Luffy" Yang.
            Their losing streak came at an end on loss #42. Shanghai got their first win against the Boston Uprising, the team that transfered Gamsu to the Dragons days prior.
            The team had a moderate season, but pulled out all of the stops when they beat the top three teams in the League, The New York Excelsior, Vancouver Titans, and San Francisco Shock, in one fell swoop.
            This miracle resulted in the Dragons winning the Stage 3 finals, which also happened to be the final stage final of the season.
            Now, the Dragons aim for the season finals.
