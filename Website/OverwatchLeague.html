    <h1> The Overwatch League </h1>

    <h2> What is Overwatch? </h2>

    <p> Overwatch is a team-based first person shooter created by Blizzard Entertainment, creators of famous titles such as World of Warcraft and Starcraft II, and publishe by Activision.
        The game was announced on November 2, 2014 but wasn't released until May 22, 2016. At it's launch, the game received a lot of praise for it's gameplay, mechanics, and unique spin on the hero shooter genre.
        The game sees the player playing as one of 31 different characters, all fitting into three different categories and having unique abilities, work with a team of five other people to complete various objectives.
        These objectives range from capturing control points to escorting a cart across a map. It's up to your team to decided who they want to approach it based on what characters they choose to do the job.
        All characters are seperated into different categories, each vital to a team's success: <ol>
            <li> Tank: A class that is rather slow moving and has short range, but acts as the front line of the team. </li>
            <li> Support: A healer class that has a hard time trying to survive on their own due to their low damage output. Typically stay </li>
            <li> Damage: The harder hitting characters in the game, but are enabled by both their tanks and supports to do their jobs </li>
            </ol></p>

    <h2> Blizzard's Newest Esport </h2>

    <p> Overwatch's Esports scene was already a thing before the game even released.
        People who were fortunate enough to get into the close alpha and beta sessions, as well as internet personalities and former Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO professional players were able to play the game behind closed doors.
        The Overwatch Esports scene didn't kick off until <i> after </i> the game launched. Various teams backed by Esports orgs competed in tournaments such as MLG Vegas and Alienware's Monthly Melee.
        At Blizzcon 2016, Blizzard unveiled their next step in Overwatch Esports, The Overwatch League.
        Esports orgs began bidding wars for the 12 spots available. Surprisingly, New England Patroits owner, Robert Kraft, secured a Boston spot.
        Before the League went into motion in 2018, a large tournament was held in Korea known as OGN APEX. This was the first and only Tournament at the time where Western and Korean talent would meet.</p>

    <h2> Growing pains </h2>

    <p> The league officially kicked off in January of 2018, and had a rather strong showing during it's first few days.
        It was the rekindling of old Esports rivarlries, such as Lunatic-Hai vs Team Envyus, now the Seoul Dynasty and Dallas Fuel respectively, and new ones, such as the Los Angeles Valiant and Los Angeles Gladiators.
        However, every sports league, either traditional or Esports, wasn't without drama, and the Overwatch League was no stranger.
        The first half of Season 1 was full of drama, and it felt like every team had their share of problems. To player having meltdowns on Twitter to corrupt orgs, many started to loose faith in the league as a whole seeing it riddled with flaws like this.
        Luckily, a lot these problems were ironed out. In the end, there will always be drama, however.
        The season was pretty quiet until the annoucnement of the stage playoffs.
        The playoffs would be held at the Barklay's center in New York City, with DJ Khalid preforming.
        After the brutal playoff rounds, only two teams stood at the top: The London Spitfire and the Philadelphia Fusion.
        London won both sets, the first was a 3-1, and the second was a clean 3-0 sweep.</p>
