    <h1> The Overwatch League </h1>

    <h2> Blizzard's Newest Esport </h2>

    <p> Overwatch's Esports scene was already a thing before the game even released.
        People who were fortunate enough to get into the close alpha and beta sessions, as well as internet personalities and former Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO professional players were able to play the game behind closed doors.
        The Overwatch Esports scene didn't kick off until <i> after </i> the game launched. Various teams backed by Esports orgs competed in tournaments such as MLG Vegas and Alienware's Monthly Melee.
        At Blizzcon 2016, Blizzard unveiled their next step in Overwatch Esports, The Overwatch League.
        Esports orgs began bidding wars for the 12 spots available. Surprisingly, New England Patroits owner, Robert Kraft, secured a Boston spot.
        Before the League went into motion in 2018, a large tournament was held in Korea known as OGN APEX. This was the first and only Tournament where Western and Korean talent would meet.
